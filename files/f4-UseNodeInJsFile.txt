## Use Node in a JS File.

* Run Node in Terminal 
    - make index.js file
    - write Simpe Code
        const hello = 'Hello World';
        console.log(hello);
    - write | node index.js | in Terminal
    - Hello World will be Printed

* Make a More Complex Program

    - write the following Code
        const fs = require('fs');
        const repl = require('repl');
    - as we see we used the | require | keyword form implement Node Libraries into Our Project
    - fs stands for FileSystem
    - REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop
